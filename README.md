# arma3server-scripts
A collection of some Batch Files for easier maintenance of an Arma3 Server. 
Designed with the usage of TADST in mind to generate the configs. 
Will help people with lots of mods due to windows character limitations in shortcuts, to easily start the server or auto restart it if process crashed. Inspiration from Seth^^, see Credits Section for more infos.
